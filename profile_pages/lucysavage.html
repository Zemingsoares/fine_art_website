Focusing on the intestine as an independent organism, I intend      to express the instinctive and responsive material of the body.<br> Today we are rapidly immersing ourselves      in the synthetic reality of the online world. As the virtual community expands, we are forgetting our physical presence      and replacing the body with the device. Whilst this unfolds, our sensory experience of the world around us is deadened.      I want to remind the viewer that they are a being of movement, sensation and instinct.<br> As a Manx artist I often      employ materials from livestock specifically bred on the Isle of Man. Whilst growing up on the island I practiced drawing      animals and humans alike, this encouraged me to regard the human as a primal and animalistic being.<br> My intestinal      sculptures range specifically between 5 and 23ft, measuring the average difference between the small and large intestine.      I often work in large-scale sculpture as a means of projecting myself as well as a method of exploring how size can      effect the viewer’s experience of themselves in relation to the work.<br>      <br> With great thanks to the following businesses who have and continue to donate material to this practice…<br>      <br> Rush Hairdressing. Pentoville Rd, Kings Cross, London.<br> Pennybridge Stables. Kirk Michael. Isle of Man <br>      Isle of Man Meats. Douglas, Isle of Man.<br>      <br> No animals have been harmed in the making of these works. It is important to me that all animal products are sourced      from living animals on free-range farms. I am often involved in the extracting of hair material to ensure it is done      safely and humanely.    </p>
