Her upbringing in Bulgaria serves      as the output for her cultural influences which are echoed throughout her work, most consistently in her video footage.      The performances are driven by borrowed texts from playwrights such as Dennis Kelly and Sarah Kane as well as her own      re-presentation of the text and characters. In her performances Victoria implicates the viewer to become part of the      performance with the use of staging and speech. This breaks the threshold between the audience and the stage and opens      up a platform which can question and challenge social constructs. Additionally, Victoria is a working actor and in      her developing work she portrays her interests of different acting techniques such as Method acting, Meisner, and Stanislavsky's      teachings.    </p>
