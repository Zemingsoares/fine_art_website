His compositions are concrete based and      the stratographic application of raw pigments as bandages allows the audience to interpret the work freely. Sometimes      as maps, textures or landscapes. Destructuring the classical easel painting, Amaury's work is reflecting a will to      interrogate spaces and their architecture. The application of his works in-situ on wall and floor raises perhaps a      desire to hide or reveal their circulation but definetly to inhabit them, continuously interrogating spaces and the      function of a painting.    </p>
