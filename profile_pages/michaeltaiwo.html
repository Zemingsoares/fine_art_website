Mumma you left but I know you tried      too, but that chest move left so many scars behind you. I remember how soft your words were and how gently they touched      parts of me I have all but closed from myself since you left. Memory lane so bitter sweet a place without a familiar      hand to hold as you walk down it. I feel the absence of you in layers under the years of my toughened skin, melting      and solidifying, reminding me a part of me will always be you, no matter how far I pull away to escape that sensitive      core of things loved and hoped for, because I was told reality crushes all things weak and I do not want to be flattened      under the weight of my emotions.    </p>
