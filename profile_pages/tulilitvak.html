Following Alain Badiou’s definition of an event as a point of rapture where the margins are centralised. This forms      the baseline of her practice.<br>      <br> In 2017, Tuli performed at the Tate Exchange as part of a collaboration between the Tate &amp; CSM and also exhibited      in ‘Transitions’, a group exhibition at the Crypt Gallery in Euston. In 2016, she participated in ‘Walking Backwards’,      a short exhibition at the Camden Arts Centre. Earlier that year, photographs of her performances were projected onto      the Royal Festival Hall at the South Bank Centre, for the 2016 ‘Women of the World Festival’. In March of that year,Tuli      also exhibited a sculpture at the ‘Do Disturb’ Festival at Palais de Tokyo in Paris. In 2013, she was the winner of      a D&amp;AD ‘Best of Year’ student award in collaboration with Dazed &amp; Confused and won a competition in 2012 in      collaboration with The Photographers Gallery, where her work was projected.    </p>
