A dedication      and obsession to create visually stimulating, romanticised adaptations of a scenario is practiced within crowds on      social media, and in this instance is the driving force behind my own Photographic, creative practice. An inability      to regurgitate the romanticised imagery, which formally exists conceptually, drives my creative processes. The desired      outcomes cannot always be recreated or translated as an exact interpretation of the illusory and idealised image. Consequentially      forming the personal mentality that the literal image never reaches a point of completion, resulting in continuous      developments within the initial ideas and within the practice itself. This narcissistic element of creation both restricts      and feeds the creative muscle, that continues to be defined by progression.    </p>
