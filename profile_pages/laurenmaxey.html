Pieces of the human body and ethereal surroundings come to      fruition of existing in different ways, through de-familiarisation and the element of the uncanny, objects being familiar      and not. Through creation, I am able to transcend the image out of time and space, giving it an alternate existence.      Within my artwork it is important to have a sense of liminality, a sense of awkwardness and unsureness, the abstract      within the work representing my imagination and subconscious.<br> I employ a sense of alchemy by preserving organic      sensations and contradicting the existence of the form, which would inevitably decay, by representing them through      mediums that stand the test of time, such as copper, resin or oil. <br> The elimination of the context of space and      proportion creates a sense of infinite, defying limitations, mimicking the vast openness of the ocean or dessert.<br>      Nature for me is a necessity and an axiom.    </p>
