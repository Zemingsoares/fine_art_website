It has no fixed form, but identifies itself through different creative      processes. Currently, it has taken the form of sign painting.<br> This generated a lot of interest in functionality      of the object and how that can be applied to painting: how we look at a sign and how we look at a painting. It took      me to a place in my work where what was written was less important than the shapes and spaces the letters created.<br>      These are all signs which I have encountered over the last year of living and working in London. Not only do they map      my movements and directly situate me in the City, they document the frequently changing high-streets and the sometimes-over-whelming      amount of written information. The paintings do not actively take a political stance but are neutral, simply highlighting      what is already there. However, as they simply reflect, almost naively, what is going on in their surroundings, the      work quickly becomes involved with gentrification and the short-term life span of many small businesses. The signs      I have chosen to re-create are all hand-made signs from non-chain organizations.    </p>
