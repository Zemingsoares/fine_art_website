This desire      prompts using the concept of ‘offering’ as a practice of exchange; a deliberate and symbolical gesture to unify a group      of people and do something as a collective. Yet, I am concerned with ‘offering’ as a language, device, and modus operandi:      by offering things that predominantly suggest or speak of the spiritual, I intend to open up an alternative platform,      such as a space of enquiry. Though, the affect and effect of this offer; such as what it could do and corollary offer      to the individual is as critical as the offer itself.    </p>
