Insignificant Tensions In My Life-2    </p>    <p id="text152" class="profileText">      I have awoken to the fact that my life is full of insignificant tensions, and I believe that subconscious memories of mine      have been dominated by these tensions. My practice describes that situation. Various materials and items that I have      picked for my artwork create some awkward balance and harmony. I have analysed each 'insignificant tension' that I      feel from the items, and tried to suggest a further tension through their placings in my work.    </p>
