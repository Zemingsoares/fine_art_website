        PROPOSAL: <br>
        <br>
        The aim of the art production is to understand the reaction of materials in terms of composition and style, the work is based on metallic elements and seminally ready made objects painted with spray paint in (silver & gold) the purpose of this action is inspired by the consumerism of 21st century and the variety of changes in the way viewers observe and appreciate art, the use of colour and material in the work is the main focus.In addition I am experimenting with light and the technicality of the reaction it has within a space. The light effects created in a space can take various of forms and reflect upon certain moods.  <br>
        <br>
        My inspiration is mainly coming from Conceptual art due to the fact of the idea behind the artwork and the emphasis to the concept rather than the final outcome, in addition my  focus is on the manipulation of advertisement, consumerism and beauty. <br>
        Silver and Gold is timeless; silver portrays the future the mechanic age and gold portrays the aesthetics of wealth in my art.<br>
        <br>
        To continue the context of the work started with the combination of Fashion-Textiles into Art the theory behind was a questions of how art can take different forms, the next step was the beauty into art and how objects can be transformed into art pieces this made me think about the value of the piece and deformation.<br>
        <br>
        The aim now is to understand the positive effects of technology and produce work, which will effectively experiment with the new technology and new digital platforms.<br>
        <br>
        Technology in art has a vast development and multiple references that affect our generation, it is a topic that we all take in consideration today and it is an accessible source for faster information and interesting new platform developments. Now days we go deeper than a 2D dimensional image, Internet has evolved and humans create microcosm to support our needs.<br>
        <br>
        These assumptions will lead my practise to investigate certain microcosm and focus on new technological forms such as virtual reality and 3D sounds and question the art of the future and how the dynamics of technology affect the process of making.
