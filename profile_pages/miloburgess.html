I find these ‘feminine’ techniques      such as sewing and stitching more interesting than high-end technology methods (which seems to be the latest obsession).      Thus, I can create stylised, textile based works corresponding with my love for fashion. I use un-primed canvas, so      the focus is on the subject matter within the unframed border and hang each artwork as an installation, creating different      viewpoints, exploring depth and perception to the (otherwise) confined 2D surface. Humour is very important to my work      too, as it can ask difficult questions in a way that people don’t feel threatened by. Laughter itself is something      universal, anyone and everyone can access it. All cultures (perhaps) use laughter in some mode or another, whether      this is in the form of a joke, or to constitute certain boundaries, determining limits.    </p>
