Sometimes, its insides resurface. Even though      the wound closes, it scars. Taking a few steps back, the forms are clearer. The different bodies are identified.<br>      <br> The pieces are made of a marriage of materials; metal, foam, and the organic. These materials respond to each      other and have a mind of their own. Leo Nataf marries them together, and fights them. The final form is not the aim.      It is the material itself, living and breathing just like him.<br>      <br> His universe is not serene - ambivalence, wanderings, and the unexpected - he plays with his intuition, watching      its unpredictability take the stage. Leo scratches, triturates, ravages… in attempt to engage these origins with the      present. This universe becomes visible. We cross it, blinded by its density, and when our eyes are saturated, they      blink. The artworks breathe. Their breath embodies spaces, and sometimes reflections; peeking shadows of past demons      in rambles.<br>      <br> His train is not to mark time, but to touch it.
