Whilst it borrows from the geometric visual vocabulary      of constructivism and the reductive aspects of minimalism, it rejects the notion of a single truth and a utopian vision      of the future. Instead, through its multi-part construction, potentially allowing almost infinite options for installation,      it reflects on the tension between control and freedom in contemporary democratic societies.<br>      <br> ‘The installation space is where we are immediately confronted with the ambiguous character of the contemporary      notion of freedom that functions in our democracies as a tension between sovereign [individual] and institutional freedom.’<br>      (Boris Groys, 'Politics of the Installation', 2009)<br>    </p>
