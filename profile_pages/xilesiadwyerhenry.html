I use my art as a form of communication; about social exclusion and how      we can see it working in material culture. I consider each piece I create a form of an advertisement, which creates      an opportunity to draw attention to social issues -where individuals are stigmatized or where education/awareness is      needed. My opinion is that we are reliant upon the media to give us coverage on issues that affect us and the people      that we live amongst, while all the time class division increases and tabloid and broadsheets create biased stances      on how issues affect us and limit what we feel we can do to fix the problem.<br> I never promise to be a cure      to any issue that I address but I agree with psychologist Erik Erikson, who tells us that as we form ‘in groups’ with      people who we as similar, and see larger contrasts between us and those that don’t fit the criteria.<br> My work is      used as a reminder that instinctively we do this subconsciously as a form of socialisation in the materials of our      daily life and culture and that we are more similar than we appear. If I can create work that draws attention to this,      we might better understand how similar we are as people.    </p>
