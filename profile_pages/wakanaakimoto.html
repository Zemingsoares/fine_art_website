It also reflects      my view on emotions and my metaphysical mind, which explored the role of words in expressions, such as the meaning      of writing poetry and the concept of invisibility.<br>      <br> The action of delving into oneâ€™s inner world is not as obvious or explicit as the outer world. Humans always look      at the outside depending on their eyes, which merely illustrate and conceive physical objects. However, the actions      that cannot be visualised and perceived by others but are capable of digging into specific subject knowledge will eventually      link objects to other elements, and this could then lead to another element of communication.<br>      <br> According to the thoughts mentioned above, I have aimed to have the final concept in relation to a space which      is in fact invisible, but could be perceived and understood by others by defining the atmosphere with words.<br>      <br> Defining the shape of space reveals the awareness of existence and non-existence significantly. I believe that      human beings cannot be released from the world, space and dimensions unless we try to see things from a different angle.    </p>
