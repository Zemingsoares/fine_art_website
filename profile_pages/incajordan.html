The screenshot has become a motif in my work and      is a dominant and recurring idea that has enabled me to examine questions around surveillance and digital culture.      The key themes I aim to address in my practice are surveillance, technology, the internet, online Panopticism and conditioning.<br>      <br> Text and image based work allows me to investigate the role of the internet in contemporary society and examine      automated systems online, challenging the tacit complicity of an individual to electronic monitoring.<br>      <br> I use a digital camcorder to capture films from which I then collate screenshots in an archival manner in order      to gain material to work alongside text pieces which form a narrative. Paintings then develop the narrative whilst      enabling me to disrupt the constancy dictated by technology, reproducing the painterly aspects of glitch in a slow,      time consuming medium.    </p>
