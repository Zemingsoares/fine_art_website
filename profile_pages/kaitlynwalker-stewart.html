As the phenomenon of the star impacts the general public and contemporary culture, the artist seeks to      question the validity of the power which is associated with celebrity status. Kaitlyn’s recent work has considered      the employment of the Red Carpet as a sculptural platform acting as a plinth for the body of celebrity, and how it      operates as a vital tool in the facilitation of para-social relations between both parties. Through re-contextualising      the Red Carpet in her practice the artist considers subjects of artifice, fabrication, hysteria, and questions how      one who desires star status can actually experience the feeling of ‘making it’. Through performance, video and installation      the artist ironically becomes the ‘star’ of her artwork, her artwork often verging on the humorous while featuring      darker undertones.    </p>
