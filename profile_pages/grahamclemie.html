They can appear inorganic, manufactured      and yet they hint at life - either past, in the form of a sarcophagus, or future, in the form of a pupa.<br>      <br> I sometimes give the objects an unfinished appearance and employ the readymade or found so as to imply an unknown      presence - perhaps some form of impromptu experiment that has just been completed or is still in progress but the perpetrator      has momentarily stepped away.<br>      <br> Pipes and hoses feature often in my work. There is a mystery to what they contain and whether they give or take.      They enhance the ambiguity of the state of life, leaving the viewer to imagine what is or was connected, to what use      they will be or were put.<br>      <br> In philosophical terms I am interested in that in-between zone that is not quite being and not quite existing.      In existential philosophy, we are not bound by our facticity; we are who we decide to be - something that has to be      reaffirmed daily. I represent this struggle of Being by creating uncanny ‘quasi-beings’ that are caught between life      and death.<br>    </p>
