I have been exploring the relationship between      how the female form is consumed as opposed to the consumption of actual food (both figuratively through the food industry      and also literally through eating). Both consumptions operate within a very particular system of preparation that seeks      to remove the areas that are desirable, can be commodified, and will ultimately be consumed from those that are ‘gross’,      imperfect and inflict feelings of disgust on the consumer. My work makes use of an extensive range of media including      video, text and sculpture. I often use meat products (or insinuation of), usually that of poultry, to represent an      ambiguous being that can exist both in the narrative of being female and of being food. Both of these beings, though      very different, are the subject of eventual mass consumption.    </p>
