Human intellect is exactly what we maintained.      Most of us grow up in the urban, which means our growth environments are established by mankind rather than by the      nature. Human beings have a sense of superiority and believe that they are standing at the top of the planet among      other creatures, including living creatures and non-living creatures, which implicate that men are omnipotent. However,      I began to doubt myself whether I was filtered out.<br>      <br> My artwork is a vehicle which creates a dialogue between the audience and their deepest darkest desires- the ones      they like to keep hidden. Distorting the medium of installation, where objects and their associations are assembled      to resemble props from a horror film. Using the visual language of a horror film set, my artwork seeks to evoke the      world of sinister possibilities horror films divulge, inciting the audience into a parallel universe where they can      delve into the sinister alter-egos they are ashamed to explore. Usually in our fantasies there are always a tendency      towards positivity; can wicked desires exist?<br> My installation strives to be a shrine that evokes peopleâ€™s wicked      wishes, even if for just a second.<br>      <br> My artwork is a vehicle which creates a dialogue between the audience and their deepest darkest desires, the ones      they like to keep hidden. Distorting the medium of installation, where objects and their associations are assembled      to resemble props from a horror film. Using the visual language of a horror film set, my artwork seeks to evoke the      world of sinister possibilities horror films divulge, inciting the audience into a parallel universe where they can      delve into the sinister alter-egos they are ashamed to explore. It is a prevailing obsession with the themes of religion,      higher power, desire and resentment. I believe that life and art coexist, our relationship with objects resembling      a religion where the relationship between an object and its user mimics that of a subject and a higher power.<br>      <br> In my project, I applied both concepts of Shamanism and animism. I danced in order to demonstrate the process      of emptying and refilling my body. At first, the dance was intended to incite the audiences into a parallel universe      where they can delve into the sinister alter-egos believed to be distinct from a person's normal or original personality      that people are ashamed to admit and keep hidden. Dancing as if I was conducting a Shamanic ritual, I was able to conjure      spirits and felt the resentment around me. The indignation confronts us with those delicate states where human beings      stray on animal's territories. Through my performance, I was split into two personalities. My soul was detached from      my body and was taken over by wraith, and then I was able to communicate with animal spirits and plants. After interaction      with animal spirits and plants, the resentment was gradually soothed. The action of falling on the ground indicated      the returning of my new ego. After being possessed by resentful spirits, the new ego realizes that animals or plants      have souls, and spirits still exist after death.<br>      <br> Anthropocentric views have provided order and structure to the understanding of humans regarding the entire world,      it has unavoidably expressed the limits of the same understanding. anthropocentrism is argued to be a narrow-minded,      parochial and submoral perspective of the world that is to a large extent charge with the predicament on animals and      the environment. By taking the non-human world as a giant renounce for humans, we are putting non-human animals at      risk and doing them harm which can only be referred to as species selfishness or species egoism.    </p>
