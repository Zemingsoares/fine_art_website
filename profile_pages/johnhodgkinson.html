Business, and particularly my family’s business, was appealing as it could nourish those very feelings.      I started to work there whilst at the same time coming back to finish my degree in Fine Art which I had started 10      years ago. Being at art school whilst seeking control, authority and power was a mismatch. However, something was pulling      me towards art and I decided to force it if it wouldn’t fit. To squeeze it. The process of the work is a collision,      collapsing. Working with those desires and impulses, scrutinizing their roots and their nature. The work starts with      a point of crisis. In fact, the very creative act is driven by crisis, trauma, and pain, and the desire to relinquish      something from it.    </p>
