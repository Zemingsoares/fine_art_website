Pools of curtains thick      and folded where different depths of dark exist and there's not one pixel size point of colour, imperceptible, at least.      She’s beside me I’m here, in the perfectly<br> clear, the years stretch, the form shirks and shape shifts, lines are      blue as the pen as the ink covers sleep, as the ink covers skin born Atlantic and proud when, then, can we meet<br>      at the top of a grassy dune, in my sleep;<br> please.      <br>      <br> Bunny rabbits racing across fields at<br> three a.m. with 4K tunnel vision, could even see dead things coming      back to life. Goodnight goodnight goodnight goodnight.    </p>
