Currently investigating the idea of Alien and Other. Why is 'race'      linked to where a body situated geographically, when in today's climate, no country is mono-cultural?<br>      <br> The goddess Venus and Putti, continually influence my practice. Venus symbolises a mythic being of birth, and      relates to my interests in the birth of mythic tropes and assumptions linked to black bodies; a puttiâ€™s ability to      transcend from the narrative of painting to the reality intrigue me, as they retain the ability to be liminal.<br>      <br> Critiquing myths through my own mythical imagery, my work centres around digital collage as a method of creating      my own utopia. Being able to merge existing imagery is vital to my practice, as collage enables me to piece together      an image that critiques imagery of stereotypes and tropes of black people.<br>      <br> Alongside digital collage, sculpture and objects involve the audience within a setting to question traditional      societal views. I want to emphasise empathy through my work by enticing my audience to interact with my work, as a      mobile from my place of thought to the audiences, to provoke inner discussions.    </p>
