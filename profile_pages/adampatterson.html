The paradise that forbids my selfhood, my individual      existence, my "I" - the same subjectivity negated by centuries of oppression - must now be repossessed, mastered and      activated. No longer shall my shores bend and gape to the prick of Empire. Let the black urchins on my back extend      arms outstretched as barbs – behold my island crowned with thorns. May the empire who maims and reduces me to paradise      run aground my coral teeth. By its sting, does a nation rise from welts. By my sting, does paradise bloom and throb      as floating terror.<br>      <br> [...]      <br>      <br> But, with my blood, could I remember nothing; a certain seductive “NOTHING” that once held “SOMETHING” – that      something taken from me long ago before my time - for I never held Africa, nor did it hold me. From the back of my      throat, froths and foams an island to my mouth – a wad of spit sloshing on my barren mother-tongue. A lightning slither      clapping through the pit of my black-bellied sheepishness that screams and sputters, “RASSHOLE” through my heart –      that which sounds my revolt – the sunrise bullet that strikes me as none other than BAJAN; none other than free. And      if I’m to tread muddled blood – if I'm to find my feet planted in these unformed lands – then so be it.      <br>      <br>By its sting, shall a people rise in welts – by the galvanize ripple smack of island’s echo, shall a nation rise      from the welts of the paradise militant.<br>      <br> - Adam Patterson, Excerpt from "Not With My Blood," 2016.    </p>
