Photography and film are media that create new space-time      relations. Interaction and communication with the figure or object is necessary and cannot be avoided. I have produced      video works with original footage, experiencing techniques such as reducing colour. <br>      <br> As I am fascinated by the conflict of presenting something un-presentable, investigating psychoanalysis during      critical study has made me more aware of my role as an artist in relation to viewers. I believe artwork is not what      we look atâ€”it is a mirror reflecting our unconsciousness. <br> I explored the connection between the uncanny and the      aesthetic in my works, as they both exist between reality and the imagination. They both come from the everyday and      then evolve to something bigger. I have looked for the uncanny in the everyday and have collected instinctual elements      to make careful thoughts about the production.<br>      <br> Viewers are invited to become part of my work by learning and growing from the experience of embodying and discerning      the verbal images. Exploring the original captivation within the objects allows me to see the world in a mysterious      and novel way.    </p>
