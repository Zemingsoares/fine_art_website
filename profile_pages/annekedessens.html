I choose to work in oil paint      because the material qualities of the substance, its consistency, mass and fluidity, are a means of extension of the      sensual delight of the mass and flesh of the body; fluid stokes of liquid paint marking the traces of the body in motion;      thin washes of paint in overlapping glazes like skin; dribbles of paint like streaks of tears or sweat. My body and      the paint understand each other because they are made from the same substance, of the earth, of rock, of organic material;      they operate in a symbiotic relationship. In the manipulation of oil paint on a surface, our bodies and the earth are      reunited in a primary and universal sense. My practice originates from repeated drawings of sculptures made from wet      substances that I especially make to paint from. The organic masses that form in the painting emanate directly from      the touch and gestures of my hand, and painting and sculpted mass form one another through this essential bodily connection.    </p>
