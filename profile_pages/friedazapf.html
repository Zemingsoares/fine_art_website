Influenced by the concept of      German artist Joseph Beuys of a ‘Social Sculpture’ – everyman is an artist by using his/her abilities to contribute      to the social organism – I am concerned with the social relation of an art work and how it can operate as a tool for      communication as opposed to the media.<br> Therefore, rather than making ‘art objects’, I am primarily working      with a method that manifests human interactions in form of speaking, but mainly listening, and social research. Participatory      art has become my practice to convey those ideas, in which I create encounters, where the artist operates as a facilitator      for communication. In “5- minute Conversations”, I create encounters for people to engage in a dialogue, through which      I seek to avoid the accumulation of spectacles in the media, listening to people’s voices rather than relying on sensational      news. My work often leaves the realm of art institutions and is placed in public places, which generates alterations      in the perception of the work. This increased my interest in studying the behaviour towards art inside and outside      the art world.    </p>
