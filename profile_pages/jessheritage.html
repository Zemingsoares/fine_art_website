Animal sound. A pip under tongue. Rupture. Hum. A split slipping. Soft Grandfather milk eyes. Yellowing blue. Pink in the center. Silence. Silence. A bird passes underfoot.<br>      <br>      Something like this, but not this.<br>      <br>      Peer closely into this vast cavity, this promising wound. Perhaps it is here where the Bear herself lies waiting as another fractured articulation, a hollow in the ground whose empty abandonment brings me closer to her than her presence ever could. She is fleeting, and speaking of her with a broken voice which cracks under a weight it is unable to sustain, a voice which wobbles and strains, squints at each edge. A wavering hand tries to catch the words. I hope she may be embodied in this voice, in the broken parts which lay strewn across the space as a mark of another failed attempt to reach her phantom image. Trying to wrap a tongue around a ‘once was’ that slips. An ecstatic fiction, a mark of the presence and absence of the figures that are gone.<br>      <br>      Trying to give these ghosts a body like mine, a body I can hold.<br>      <br>      <br>      Performances daily.</i>    </p>
