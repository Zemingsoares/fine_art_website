A picture is      a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable centers of culture. Similar to those eternal copyists Bouvard and      PÃ©cuchet, we indicate the profound ridiculousness that is precisely the truth of painting. We can only imitate a gesture      that is always anterior, never original. Succeeding the painter, the plagiarist no longer bears within them passions,      humours, feelings, impressions, but rather this immense encyclopedia from which they draw. The viewer is the tablet      on which all the quotations that make up a painting are inscribed without any of them being lost. A painting's meaning      lies not in its origin, but in its destination. The birth of the viewer must be at the cost of the painter."    </p>
