Formally a mother      to these sculptures, Dixon still cares for them but more recently through cultivation. Influenced by research into      the male genius, these sculptures challenge the idea that women artists cannot be geniuses. Some previous sculptures      mimic traditional forms and materials used in sculpture used by male artists, and from a far Dixon’s sculptures look      like their are made from clay or stone, but looking closely they aren’t what might be expected. They are a false copy      of natural and historical sculptural materials. Conveying an idea that gender prevents Dixon from making sculpture      in a traditional way that has always been male dominated. These sculptures also have a strong connection to nature      and come up from the ground, ever evolving and ever growing.    </p>
