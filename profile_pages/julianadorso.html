Reader Digest Of My Beloved Work_ Photograph, print, inks<br>    </p>    <p id="text52" class="profileText">I am a visual poet, a painter inspired by Virginia Woolf’s books.<br> My work explores the idea of “A Room of One’s Own”,      Woolf’s assertion that to have a room of one’s own is to have the right and the possibility to be independent and have      a place which belongs to you to live, to write, to think. My ‘rooms’ are pictorial spaces, painted outfits created      in canvas that can speak, walk, present for themselves. I translate this literary concept into a visual field; a place      for the imagination, fiction and re-made memories, where it can be seen from different standpoints in the world.<br>      <br> For me, my room of one’s own is the act of painting, and when I share painting with others, through outfits or      objects-to-be-performed-by-others, I create a kind of common room of one’s own. This figurative gesture offers a nomadic      proposition - we can create by ourselves or with others, it can happen anywhere no matter how constrained.<br>      <br> My work is concerned with creating a dialogue between territories, memories and people in order to create a poetic      place. Sometimes it could be a situation made by paintings, sometimes it could be a performance made by outfits, or      parades, or animations, words and images. I am open to whatever develops out of my research through talking to people,      looking at the world, collecting images, opinions and ideas. <br> I am inspired by people’s different backgrounds and      artistic fields, such as aesthetic poetry, literature, music, cinema, theater and opera. Whatever the medium, I always      feel by overlapping layers I can create a painting that offers not a form of re-enactment the opportunity to re-make,      re-imagine, re-invent.    </p>
