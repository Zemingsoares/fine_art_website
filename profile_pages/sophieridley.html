A woman sits texting opposite the tinny sound of something familiar playing in her ears. <br> There are so many      places that i've been through countless times but never set foot in. They are so familiar, but unrecognisable. I pass      the same orange square time and time again. Never seeing anyone in the window but the light is always on. I have no      idea who you are or really where you are but you are always there, somewhere and nowhere. The places I pass become      a clock a marker of how long till I get home. Is the train a clock to you? You are nowhere to me and I am nowhere to      you but I have looked at your window more than I have looked at the woman opposite me on the train. I am nowhere but      I am going home.    </p>
