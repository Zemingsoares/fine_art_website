If the slip is the space to not recognise oneself and boredom a state of being which deposits nothing      outside of its self, then we continually spin around a state of no purpose, nothing to then achieve. The failure to      recognise oneself then isn't to 'get' anywhere else, to not recognise only to assimilate a new language. Rather it      is the language.<br>      <br> 'Thomas the Obscure' (Marurice Blanchot 1941) then does not roam in the dark only to find the light, "through      this void, it was sight and the object of sight which mingled together" (Station Hill Press, New York, translated 1973,      p. 15). To be empty in what marxists designate as leisure time (in opposition to labour time, where we produce) as      the place for freedom, available to the masses along with reproductions in the 20th century, can no longer be stated.      These boundaries no longer prevail and all time is work time for the production of data. To slip needs reclaiming,      boredom needs maintaining to be able to write, think and make.    </p>
