Life in London is like a joke made by Satan and the rain drops      sound like waves of teasement from above. Needless to say, even if everything has gone well, you constantly feel deprived      and defeated.<br>      <br> But now, you are standing in front of a painting of cats. They're formed by combinations of colours in various      shapes that became the image of what is in front of you: a bunch of fat lazy cats.<br>      <br> As you look closer and longer into this painting, you will begin to emerge yourself into this ambiguous atmosphere      of soothness, the colours will engulf your mind and swollow up the negativity from the recent past, the previous unbearable      thoughts that almost crushed you into pieces are diluted into strokes of relief, a release set by the comfortable shapes      of these relaxing figures.<br>      <br> You are now a fat lazy cat.    </p>
