A sensation that is an optical and tactile movement.      Painting allows me to materialise the dialectic between seeing, touching, doing and knowing. Painting is a mode of      construction: I'm not attached to a form, but to the conditions of its emergence. Each work produces a residue that      leaves a reservoir of materials for subsquent work. I go back and forth, in a loop, between collage, painting and writing.<br>      <br> I am interested in playing with and disrupting the elements that traditionally belong to the pictorial plane.      I aim to maintain ambiguities and tensions that are underlying or imposed by the support, in order to enhance the importance      of the technique and temporality, of building up the surface. In its thickness, a painting is not only a window on      the world but a door-window: we go in, we go out. The use of transparent material enables me to paint on both sides.      This rotation allows me to avoid the preconception of the final result. Between transparency and opacity, the layers      overlap each other, blurring the planes like the strata of memories, pulled between doubt and certainty.    </p>
