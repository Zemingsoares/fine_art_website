Its script-like twists      turn out to be unreadable and tangled. Its vocabulary is rich and playful. The viewer is met with families of curving,      gestural shapes - the shapes of natural movement - which are subsequently complicated through familiar symbols of luxury      and glamour. There is a sense of things being mis-scaled and uncanny like a stretched memory of childhood play. It      wants to be touched, it wants to be played with. Its childishness is made strange by its glamour and its glamour is      made strange by its childishness. It rejects the straightness of pragmatism and gravity, curling around all that’s      regimented with fondling, reaching limbs. Her world is deeply soft, edgeless and unsettled.    </p>
