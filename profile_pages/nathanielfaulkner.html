This arguably perpetuates an objective and empirical theory of science, one which can      refute the ‘unscientific’ practices of other cultures. This relationship between myth and science is where I try and      situate myself and the things I make, often drawing from myths and symbols of ancient and pre-history, most of which      I encounter via antiquities and historical sites. These archetypal motifs of the historical are combined with current      references and products of contemporary culture.    </p>
