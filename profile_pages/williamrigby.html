Was about      to tweet “who the fuck is Elon Musk” but saved it as a draft, then scrolled through Kendall Jenners Twitter feed while      persistently, mentally picturing Caitlyn Jenner speaking them aloud in a robotic, heavily affected, seemingly, “dystopian”      manner. Put down my phone and took ‘Das Kapital’ out of my bag. After reading for 5-10 minutes, maybe 4 pages, that      I re-read at least twice, sometimes up to 5 times before continuing with only a vague understanding and a stronger,      lingering sense of exhaustion, I picked up my phone and tweeted “started reading ‘Das Kapital’ but stopped after ~5minutes      because I literally don’t care”.    </p>
