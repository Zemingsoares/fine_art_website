I choose to work with very specific      ‘things’, each of which will dictate a diverse and distinctive approach accompanied by the use of materials I deem      appropriate.      <br>      <br> When I am creating the work I always contemplate the importance of the viewer ‘double taking’. Some may not even      know what exactly it is that they are observing. Through situating my artwork back in the street where I initially      found and responded to the detritus, I allow the viewer an unexpected connection to the piece. My reason for placing      the work back outside, is so that it has the exact same surroundings that the detritus once had.<br>      <br> The pieces are somewhat ephemeral and it is difficult to predict how long they will remain in one place. Documentation      plays a huge role in my practice as it allows me to record the event and incorporate it into publications. I bring      only hints of the work back to the studio or gallery to assist people in accessing the work.    </p>
