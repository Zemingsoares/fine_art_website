My performative work is a non-event, yet its structure is very precise,      as I want to make sure you don't notice it until I am done performing.<br>      <br> My writing is the exact opposite. It is loaded with images, and noticeably staged. The silences count as much      as the text. It is important to let a message settle in before moving on to the next one. Take it as a score for thoughts.<br>      <br> They both complement each other and often overlap, sometimes making the boundary between my performances and my      writing very blurry.    </p>
