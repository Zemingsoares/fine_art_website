The repeated rhythm of daily life is observed through indexical action and object: traces      of the body in motion recorded in an open-ended project of critical research. By engaging in the routine everyday,      my work explores the dissolving distinction between art and environment, between process and finished work, and between      inside and outside. The mundane repetitive activity of the domestic home, dominated by time-based routine, is juxtaposed      with alternative temporal rhythms of the natural world in an attempt to engage with the world and question and consider      what happens when nothing happens?    </p>
