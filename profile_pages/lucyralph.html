Whilst being inspired by great poets of the 20th Century, my paintings      connect my own personal experiences, current world affairs and carefully selected objects to create fictional, timeless,      placeless compositions that embody a sense of struggle and hope.<br> My fabricated, fragmented figures seem ghost-like      to create an ironic distance with the viewer, depicting what we know about people whilst demonstrating the contemporary,      chaotic and fragile state of humanity. By creating this distance, I aim to invite the viewer into a space to imagine      and speculate, and this brings them closer to the sensitive realities that I am responding to in my paintings.<br>      Often, I combine these reoccurring themes into installations of which I use a variety of materials, processes and objects,      to work in a meaningful dialogue with particular paintings. Through the production of my practice, alongside continuous      research and self reflection, I am constantly envisioning my next body of work.<br>    </p>
