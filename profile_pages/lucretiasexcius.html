In PowerNomics,      Dr. Anderson teaches black communities, how to practice capitalism in a society that is based on capitalism. He offers      these communities specific principles, strategies and activities to use ,in order to own and control resources, to      produce group wealth, become more self-sufficient and economically competitive. Anderson suggests that Black people,      have been disproportionately exploited by economics and that we must use the very same system to our advantage and      since racism is a group sport, we must tackle its effects as a group.<br> My work is inspired by these concept`s and      I have chosen to use a pyramid in order to highlight the principles and also demonstrate how effective working in this      way can be. Black participants were invited to participate in this project by donating unwanted pennies. These coins      represent change and highlight the collective power of working as a group. All participants now own a percentage of      this pyramid, which we hope to sell at a profit. We will then reinvest the proceeds, as a collective. The idea is not      to make a large amount of money but rather to highlight the principles of Dr Anderson`s work.<br>      <br> Specifications/      <br> Base/ size- 5`6 ft sq, timber frame<br> Total overall height-9ft<br> Side panels,11ft,MDF panels, covered with      one penny coins Short film,played inside the structure    </p>
